# Project Title

This repository is a basic WordPress plugin created to illustrate a blog post about Rewrite Rules in WordPress.

Its main function is to:
- register a new `/dashboard/<page>` route to create a user Dashboard page,
- load a new PHP template file to display the new Dashboard page content,
- redirect non logged-in users when accessing this Dashboard page.
